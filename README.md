> Open source project for solving mazes using computer vision and pathfinding algorithms.


This project is a collection of computer vision techniques designed to **read**, **optimize**, and **process images**, with a specific focus on **solving mazes** from image files using algorithms like **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Load and preprocess maze images (grayscale, thresholding)
- Convert images into navigable grids
- Solve mazes using BFS for shortest pathfinding
- Visualize the path over the original maze
- Modular structure for easy experimentation and extension

## 📷 Example

Input Maze (Image) → Grayscale → Binary → Solved Maze with Path:
